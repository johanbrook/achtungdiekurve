# Achtung Die Kurve

A multiplayer game written in Javascript and Java, using WebSockets and Canvas.

The system is completely directed by the server. I.e., all logic resides in Java code, and the client is merely a visual representation of the game world. Even the client redrawing is controlled by the server (over WebSockets). This may or may not be a good thing, but we wanted to try it out.
